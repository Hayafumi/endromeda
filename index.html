      some things to endromeda.<br/><br/>

<p class="title">5.22.2021 - cleaner code & favicon
<br>--------------------------------------</p>
    <p class="description">
      sup, in this entire website, i've been using<br>
      several style tags, and the code looked like<br>
      a MESS. now, most of the crap is on classes<br>
      on a css file. and now there's FINALLY a<br>
      favicon.<br/><br/>
      most of the site has not been cleaned up,<br>
      i've only done the home page, but the entire<br>
      site will be much cleaner!<br>
<p class="title">5.22.2021 - rss feed
<br>--------------------------------------</p>
    <p class="description">
      it's been awhile since i've updated the website<br>
      but, i've added a rss feed for articles, if you<br>
      want to add the rss feed, the feed url will be<br>
      in the articles page, have fun!<br>
<p class="title">5.3.2021 - articles!!!
<br>--------------------------------------</p>
    <p class="description">

      i've decided to add a new part of the website,<br>
      articles!<br /><br />
      no longer the links page,which was pointless<br>
      is now replaced with something much more useful!<br>
      artices is about anything, tech, food, anything.<br>
