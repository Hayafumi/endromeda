               <p>
                  At the bottom of every articles, there is a comment box now using <a href="https://core.telegram.org/widgets">Telegram Widgets.<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15">

               <p>
                  Though, a caveat using Telegram is that you really can't customize it & you must have a Telegram account.

               <h2>Links page is back...</h2>
               <h5>September 29, 2021</h5>
               <p>
                  The links page is back, after being replaced with the Posts page.
               </p>
               <p>But now with an use, I had 88x31 buttons on the footer on every page, which didn't look good.
               <p>
                  So, I brang back the links page with buttons for this website, and buttons from other websites.
               </p>
               <p>
                  Alongside that, I removed Null Webring and removed most of the 88x31 Buttons and moved them to the Links page,
                  but added some new buttons on the footer.
               </p>
               <h2>Minor name change</h2>
               <h5>September 21, 2021</h5>
               <p>
                  As you may already notice, i've done the <i>most minor</i> name change.
               </p>
               <p>
                  I've changed the "E" from "Endromeda" to an "A"... <strong>SHOCKING!!!</strong>
                  So it's now "Andromeda". Unfortunately, the name "Andromeda" is taken so I can't
                  change the url :(.
               </p>
               <h2>Unlisted Articles</h2>
               <h5>September 10, 2021</h5>
               <p>
                  As you may already seen, I unlisted <strong><i>ALL</i></strong> articles except the "Ubuntu is horrible" article. Due to these main reasons:
               </p>
               <ul>
                  <li>Opinions changing</li>
                  <li>Terribly written</li>
                  <li>Most are non-argumented rants</li>
               </ul>
               <p>So I unlist them, but they're not deleted... You're still able to access them if you have the link to them. And not to forget, I did some updates to the website.
                  Most are minor though, like an icon for links. A slightly major update is that we now have a button! You can add it to your website
                  if you want.
               </p>
               <p>
                  One last thing before I go, i've joined the 
                  <a href="https://nuthead.neocities.org/ring/">
                     Null Webring!
                     <span>
                        <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15">
                           <path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path>
                           <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon>

                     </span>
                  </a>
                  But aside from that, that's all.
               <h5>Update: The "Ubuntu is horrible" article is now unlisted.</h5>
               <h2>A new layout, again...</h2>
               <h5>August 22, 2021</h5>

               <h5>August 8, 2021</h5>
               <p>
                  You may be wondering, what happend to the site. Well, we just changed layouts! Reason being the old layout had garbage CSS. And I want to change the look of the website, of course.
