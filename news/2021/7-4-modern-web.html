<p class="title">Modern Web is a bloated mess<br>--------------------------------------</p>
    <p class="description">
      The birth of the web was a basic one, simple<br>
      text documents and gifs. Nowadays, the web is<br>
      such a bloated mess, you can't have a single<br>
      bit of privacy now.<br/>
  <p class="paragraph_name">Pool of Javascript files</p>
    <p class="description">
      Why does every single website have a boatload of<br>
      Javascript files? Javascript was a mistake from the start,<br>
      PHP is arguably alot better than JS. You don't need JS to make<br>
      a good website. Most of the websites of JS are bad anyways,<br>
      they take up resources and take forever to load.
      <br><br/>
      Even though Javascript does have a few benefits, most websites use so much<br>
      Javascript files it's unbelievable.<br/>
  <p class="paragraph_name">Advertisements and Pop-Ups</p>
    <p class="description">
      So many websites have a ton of Pop-Ups and Advertisements, so much that<br>
      something simple as scrolling the website could be choppy and laggy.<br>
      You're better off filling the whole page with them and not see a single<br>
      pixel of the actual content that you're looking for, and why the hell<br>
      do you have to make an account just to view the website? To try and<br>
      get more members on the site?<br/>
  <p class="paragraph_name">Sell all my information!</p>
    <p class="description">
      Do you seriously have any privacy on the modern internet, corporations<br>
      like Facebook have millions of personal data, almost everything about<br>
      them. Knowing that my personal information about me is being sold<br>
      scares the shit out of me.
      <br><br/>
      You do not have privacy, pretty much multiple corporations are watching<br>
      what you're doing every second.<br>
