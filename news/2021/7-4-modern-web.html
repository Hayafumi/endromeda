<p class="title">Modern Web is a bloated mess<br>--------------------------------------</p>
    <p class="description">
      The birth of the web was a basic one, simple<br>
      text documents and gifs. Nowadays, the web is<br>
      such a blaoted mess, you can't have a single<br>
      bit of privacy now.<br>
  <p class="paragraph_name">Pool of Javascript files</p>
    <p class="description">
      Why does every single website have a boatload of Javascript files?
      Javascript was a mistake from the start, PHP is arguably alot better than
      JS. You don't need JS to make a good website. Most of the websites of JS
      are bad anyways, they take up resources and take forever to load.
      <br><br/>
      Even though Javascript does have a few benifits, most websites use so much<br>
      Javascript files it's unbelieveable.
  <p class="paragraph_name">Advertisements and Pop-Ups</p>
    <p class="description">
      So much websites have a ton of Pop-Ups and Advertisements, so much that
      something simple as scrolling the website could be choppy and laggy.
      You're better off filling the whole page with them and not see a single
      pixel of the actual content that you're looking for, and why the hell
      do you have to make an account just to view the website? To try and
      get more members on the site?
  <p class="paragraph_name">Sell all my information!</p>
    <p class="description">
      Do you seriously have any privacy in the modern internet, corporations
      like Facebook has millions personal data, almost everything about them.
      Knowning that my personal information about me is being sold scares
      the shit out of me.
      <br><br/>
      You do not have privacy, pretty much multible corporations are watching<br>
      what you're doing every second.
