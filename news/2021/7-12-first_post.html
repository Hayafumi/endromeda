                        You're currently viewing the first endromeda post. I've given articles another purpose, where I can make posts that aren't as long as articles, because why not? There are some answers you may have and I'm going to answer them in this post.
                    </p>
                <h3>Will there be articles?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Of course, even though I currently don't have ideas for any articles, articles will be made along with posts.
                    </p>
                <h3> What are posts?</h3>
                    <p>
                        They're pretty much blogs, I'm going to be making posts like devlogs of endromeda and such.
                    </p>
                <h3>What will happend to the old articles?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Nothing, you can still access them.
                    </p>
                <h3>Will there going to be often articles/posts?</h3>
                    <p>
                        I might make more often articles, I have no ideas though. For posts, I would only post whenever I feel like it.
