                  Didn't expect for me to make another log so quickly, but a bit more advancements has been made to my Hackintosh.

                  "In addition, the default Secure Boot model has been changed to x86legacy (from j137 - iMacPro1,1) which restricts boot to 11.0.1 and up.<br><br>
                  Why do you care? Well, if you're using OC with SecureBootModel set to Default, you won't be able to boot High Sierra - Catalina anymore without changing the value. And if you don't have Big Sur or above installed on the <b>same disk</b>, you won't <b>even see APFS volumes in the boot picker</b>"
               </div>
               <p>
                  After reading i've immediately started on creating an OC Configuration from scratch.. To fix the issue, I had to change <code>SecureBootModel</code> from <code>Default</code> to <code>j137</code>. After finishing editing <code>config.plist</code>,
                  With fingers crossed, I booted into the USB with OpenCore and hoping it will boot into Catalina.
               </p>
               <p>
                  And to my surprise, it booted! Was finally updated OpenCore to 0.7.2, including updated Kexts. After that I fixed

               <h3>Installing Big Sur</h3>
               <p>
                  I decided to install Big Sur on my SSD along with Catalina. It went sucessful and without a notification on Catalina bugging me.
               </p>
               <div>
                  <img src="big_sur-about-my-mac.png" width="530">
                  <br>
                  Unfortunately didn't screenshot me installing Big Sur, so here's About my Mac!
               </div>
               <p>
                  Only thing that was annoying was that there was a "Update" drive on Catalina, but after some reading it's important for Big Sur, so I can't do anything with it :(.
               </p>
               <h3>Ironing even more issues</h3>
               <p>
                  Another issue I always had was a "EFI" entry on the Boot Picker, to whiched I want to wipe off the face of the Earth. As mentioned in Log #1:
               </p>
               <div class="box rounded">
                  "EFI" entry shows on Boot Picker despite there's nothing but the OC folder
               </div>
               <p>
                  But, it dissapear when I made a EFI folder from scratch, could be an issue with the one off of GitHub.
               </p>
               <h3>Drive icons with OpenCanopy</h3>
               <p>
                  I've also wanted to make OpenCanopy look more nice, by using custom drive icons for each version of macOS that was shown on the picker.
               </p>
               <p>
                  After reading the OpenCore documentation, I figured out that you have to change <code>PickerAttribute</code> to <code>145</code> and put <code>&lt;flavor&gt;.icns</code> on the Resources folder. So, I did it. After getting the icons from

                  </a>
                  , I finally had drive icons that show the macOS logo for each version.

               <h3>Final words</h3>
               <p>
                  Finally being able to fix some problems that always bugged me, and finally installing Big Sur was relieving. But that's all for this log, Log #4 will come soon... Bye!
