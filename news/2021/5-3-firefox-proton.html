			    <h2>Why Firefox Proton is SHIT</h2>
			    <h5>May 3, 2021</h5>
			        <p>
                        Somewhere in February 2021, Firefox has put a new Proton redesign in the nightly builds of Firefox. In this article, Iâ€™m going to be ranting on why the Firefox Proton redesign is absolute <b>SHIT.</b>
                    </p>
                <h3>"Tabs"</h3>
                    <p>
The tabs look like crap, it's unnecessary big enough and takes a lot of web content. Large and rounded tabs are not necessary and it looks ugly as fuck. It doesn't even look like proper tabs, they're not attached to the navigation bar. It's just floating pill shape buttons that are way too big for my liking, and most likings.
                    </p>
                    <div>
                        <img src="/news/2021/proton-tabs.png" width="100%">
                        <br>
                        Tabs Bar on Firefox 91.
                    </div>    
                <h3>Padding for touch screens?</h3>
                    <p>
                        The spacing between everything, it's disgusting. Everything is so spread out and so big, it's like it's made for a tablet, did Mozilla forget that Do PCs and Macs exist? Most of them don't even have a touch screen. Even if they made it for tablets or whatever, why? The buttons are big enough that a finger can touch, why more padding to space them out?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Some of you may ask, "why are you complaining just use compact mode?". Mozilla had the BALLS to remove Compact mode from the proton redesign saying that it's "Unsupported", Unsupported my ASS you could have just minimized the padding and make everything smaller, but no! We're stuck with the big as fuck UI that looks like it's made for a touch screen.
                    </p>
                <h3>Edit:</h3>
                <p> I recently heard that it is possible to disable the shit redesign through a config in about:config, Thanks to Mozilla for having a brain cell. </p>
