<p class="title">Why Firefox Proton is SHIT<br>--------------------------------------</p>
    <p class="description">
      Somewhere in February 2021, Firefox has put<br>
      a new Proton redesign in the nightly builds<br>
      of Firefox. In this article, I’m going to be<br>
      ranting on why the Firefox Proton redesign<br>
      is absolute SHIT.<br/>
      <p class="paragraph_name">"Tabs"</p>
    <p class="description">
      The tabs look like crap, it's unnecessary big enough and takes a lot of<br>
      web content. Large and rounded tabs are not necessary and it looks ugly<br>
      as fuck. It doesn't even look like proper tabs, they're not attached to<br>
      the navigation bar. It's just floating pill shape buttons that are<br>
      way too big for my liking, and most likings.<br/>
      <p class="paragraph_name">"Padding for touch screens?</p>
    <p class="description">
      The spacing between everything, it's disgusting. Everything is so spread<br>
      out and so big, it's like it's made for a tablet, did Mozilla forget that<br>
      Do PCs and Macs exist? Most of them don't even have a touch screen.<br>
      Even if they made it for tablets or whatever, why? The buttons are big enough<br>
      that a finger can touch, why more padding to space them out?<br>
      <br/>
      Some of you may ask, "why are you complaining just use compact mode?".<br>
      Mozilla had the BALLS to remove Compact mode from the proton redesign<br>
      saying that it's "Unsupported", Unsupported my ASS you could have just<br>
      minimized the padding and make everything smaller, but no! We're<br>
      stuck with the big as fuck UI that looks like it's made for a touch screen.<br>
      <p class="edit">Edit:</p>
    <p class="description">
      I recently heard that it is possible to disable<br>
      the shit redesign through a config in about:config,<br>
      Thanks to Mozilla for having a brain cell.<br>
