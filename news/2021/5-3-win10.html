<b style="font-size:15px;">WIndows 10 is a dumpster</b>
<hr>
    <p>
        Windows 10 is an absolute dumpster in fire.
        It's an absolute resource hogger, it's spyware
        and looks terrible, there is some ways to make
        Windows 10 a bit more tolerable.<br><br>
    <b>What Consistency?</b>
    <p>
        Windows 10's design is such a mess, it's a part of a
        landfill. Including the absolute mess of DLL files all over Windows, you got
        Fluent Design icons, Old Windows 10 Icons (Pre-2004), Windows 7 icons, The
        semi-rare Windows XP icons, and the ancient Windows 95 icons.<br />    
        <br />
        Where is the consistency? The monkeys at Microsoft could have taken the time
        and create a new icon for all the DLLâ€™s with all of the Old icons, but no!
        Instead, just leave them be while we create new icons to make it more of a
        mess!<br><br>
    <b>A eyesore of a UI</b>
    <p>
        Windows 10 UI is bland as the Nintendo Switch UI, it's ugly and flat
        as hell. Light Mode is so blinding, it's not even a good implementation
        of light mode, it's just #FFFFF all over the place, it's a mess.
        The dark mode is even worse, It's way too dark and is mostly just pitch
        black, A lot of parts of Windows still uses light mode, creating the worse
        theme ever with Dark Mode/Light Mode.<br/>
        <br />
    <b>Who needs Privacy?</b>
    <p>
        Ever since Windows 8, Microsoft decided to amp up on the data collecting,
        Microsoft does so much data collecting, you probably have to give out
        everything about you to Microsoft, and you can't even disable some of
        of the data collecting, like Telemetry. A lot of Windows 10's "features"
        requires some kind of data collecting, there's no privacy using Windows 10.
        Something simple as Bitlocker on Windows 10, sells your fucking data.
  
        And it's not just Microsoft collecting data, other companies even do this same bullshit, You don't have privacy on the internet.<br><br>
    <b>Edit:</b>
    <p>
        So apparently Microsoft is starting to ditch
        the old Windows 10, 7, XP, and 95-era icons
        from Windows 10, it really took them THAT
        long to change fucking icons, nice.
