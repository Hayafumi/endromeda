<p class="title">Windows 10 is a dumpster<br>--------------------------------------</p>
    <p class="description">
      Windows 10 is an absolute dumpster in fire.<br>
      It's an absolute resource hogger, it's spyware<br>
      and looks terrible, there is some ways to make<br>
      Windows 10 a bit more tolerable.<br/>
      <p class="paragraph_name">What Consistency?</p>
    <p class="description">
      Windows 10's design is such a mess, it's a part of a landfill.<br>
      Including the absolute mess of DLL files all over Windows, you got<br>
      Fluent Design icons, Old Windows 10 Icons (Pre-2004), Windows 7 icons<br>
      The semi-rare Windows XP icons, and the ancient Windows 95 icons.<br />    
      <br />
      Where is the consistency? The monkeys at Microsoft could have taken<br>
      the time and create a new icon for all the DLL’s with all of the old<br>
      icons, but no! Instead, just leave them be while we create new icons<br>
      to make it more of a mess!<br/>
      <p class="paragraph_name">A eyesore of a UI</p>
    <p class="description">
      Windows 10 UI is bland as the Nintendo Switch UI, it's ugly and flat
      as hell. Light Mode is so blinding, it's not even a good implementation
      of light mode, it's just #FFFFF all over the place, it's a mess.
      The dark mode is even worse, It's way too dark and is mostly just pitch
      black, A lot of parts of Windows still uses light mode, creating the worse
      theme ever with Dark Mode/Light Mode.<br/>

      <p class="paragraph_name">Who needs Privacy?</p>
    <p class="description">
      Ever since Windows 8, Microsoft decided to amp up on the data collecting,
      Microsoft does so much data collecting, you probably have to give out
      everything about you to Microsoft, and you can't even disable some of
      of the data collecting, like Telemetry. A lot of Windows 10's "features"
      requires some kind of data collecting, there's no privacy using Windows 10.
      Something simple as Bitlocker on Windows 10, sells your fucking data.

      And it's not just Microsoft collecting data, other companies even do this same bullshit, You don't have privacy on the internet.
      <p class="edit">Edit:</p>
    <p class="description">
      So apparently Microsoft is starting to ditch<br>
      the old Windows 10, 7, XP, and 95-era icons<br>
      from Windows 10, it really took them THAT<br>
      long to change fucking icons, nice.<br>
