      The DeviantART redesign is one of the worst<br>
      redesigns I've ever seen, Even worse than<br>
      YouTube Polymer, it's a buggy, slow, confusing<br>
      mess of a redesign.
      <p class="paragraph_name">Login to download</p>
    <p class="description">
      This is one of the worst "features" that DeviantArt<br>
      ever made, you HAVE to log in or create an account just to download<br>
      something, why?<br/><br/>
      It's not necessary to force people to create an account just for<br>
      downloads, it wasn't like this before, when you click download you<br>
      get the download. Most of your userbase are just accounts with<br>
      nothing that are ONLY used just for downloads, no actual creators<br>
      and stuff.<br>
      <p class="paragraph_name">Forced redesign</p>
    <p class="description">
      As I said, the redesign SUCKS, DeviantART was using the same design for a<br>
      decade. If it works, don't fix it, But DeviantART alongside the god-awful<br>
      forced login to download feature, which was forced!<br/>
      Well before, DeviantArt gave you an option to disable the redesign but<br>
      later on, they REMOVED it. Forcing you to use it, if you like it or not. At<br>
      least Reddit had some sense about putting their old design in old.reddit.com,<br>
      you can even make it the main layout of the website
