			    <h2>DeviantART Sucks</h2>
			    <h5>May 26, 2021</h5>
			        <p>
                        The DeviantART redesign is one of the worst redesigns I've ever seen, Even worse than YouTube Polymer, it's a buggy, slow, confusing mess of a redesign.
                    </p>
                <h3>Login to download</h3>
                    <p>
                        This is one of the worst "features" that DeviantArt ever made, you HAVE to log in or create an account just to download something, why?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It's not necessary to force people to create an account just for downloads, it wasn't like this before, when you click download your get the download. Most of your userbase are just accounts with nothing that are ONLY used just for downloads, no actual creators and stuff.
                    </p>

                <h3>Forced redesign</h3>
                    <p>
                        As I said, the redesign SUCKS, DeviantART was using the same design for a decade. If it works, don't fix it, But DeviantART alongside the god-awful forced login to download feature, which was forced!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Well before, DeviantArt gave you an option to disable the redesign but later on, they REMOVED it. Forcing you to use it, if you like it or not. At least Reddit had some sense about putting their old design in old.reddit.com, you can even make it the main layout of the website
