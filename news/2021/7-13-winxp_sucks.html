			    <h2>Windows XP is Overrated</h2>
			    <h5>July 13, 2021</h5>
                    <p>
                        Windows XP is one of the ugliest and most
                        overrated operating systems are known to man.
                        And people who weren't even born when XP was
                        released say that it's the "best OS" ever.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Ugly Theme</h3>
                    <p>
                        Windows XP's "Luna" theme looks like absolute
                        garbage. It's literally a Fisher-Price theme for an operating system.
                        Classic Theme is a lot better doesn't hurt one's eyes. Without the
                        dog ugly theme, it's essentially Windows 2000

                    <p>
                        The fandom for Windows XP (and Windows in general) is one of the dumbest
                        communities that one would ever see. The fandom is consists of Children
                        who weren't even born when XP was around, and having fake nostalgia for
                        Windows XP, and also think that it's the best OS ever. When they've
                        clearly only tried it in a Virtual Machine.

                    The fandom for Windows XP (and Windows in general) is one of the dumbest
                    communities that one would ever see. The fandom is consists of Children

                    <p>
                        Windows XP wasn't *the* best operating system that everybody keeps
                        saying, using XP now is impossible without CVE exploits, people
                        still use XP even after the End-Of-Life and all the CVE exploits.
                    </p><p>
                        Is really using an outdated Operating System from 20 years ago
                        that has multiple security issues just to have nostalgia from
                        a "simpler time"? Times changed, move on from XP.
