<p class="title">Windows XP is Overrated<br>--------------------------------------</p>
    <p class="description">
      Windows XP is one of the most ugliest and the<br>
      most overrated operating system known to man.<br>
      And people who weren't even born when XP was<br>
      released says that it's the "best OS" ever.<br>

  <p class="paragraph_name">Ugly theme</p>
    <p class="description">
      Windows XP's "Luna" theme looks like absolute<br>
      garbage. It's literally a Fisher Price theme for a operating system.<br>
      Classic Theme is alot better doesn't hurt ones eyes. Without the<br>
      dog ugly theme, it's essentially Windows 2000

    <p class="description">
      The fandom for Windows XP (and Windows in general) is one of the most
      dumbest community that one would ever see. The fandom is consist of
      Children who weren't even born when XP was around, and having fake
      nostalgia of Windows XP, and also thinks that it's the best OS ever.
      When they've clearly only tried it in a Virtual Machine.

      Almost everybody that talks about Windows XP always mentions Windows
      Movie Maker. It's not even a good editor, then why everybody keeps
      talking about it? Sure most videos on YouTube at the time was MADE
      with Movie Maker but not everything during that time was made with
      Windows Movie Maker only.

      Windows XP wasn't *the* best operating system that everybody keeps
      saying, using XP now is impossible without CVE exploits, people 
      still use XP even after the End-Of-Life and all the CVE exploits.
      <br><br/>
      Is really using a outdated Operating System from 20 years ago
      that has multible security issues just to have nostagia from
      a "simpler time"? Times changed, move on from XP.
