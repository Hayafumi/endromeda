<p class="title">Windows XP is Overrated<br>--------------------------------------</p>
    <p class="description">
      Windows XP is one of the ugliest and most <br>
      overrated operating systems are known to man.<br>
      And people who weren't even born when XP was<br>
      released say that it's the "best OS" ever.<br>
      Ugly theme<br><br/>
  <p class="paragraph_name">Ugly theme</p>
    <p class="description">
      Windows XP's "Luna" theme looks like absolute<br>
      garbage. It's literally a Fisher-Price theme for an operating system.<br>
      Classic Theme is a lot better doesn't hurt one's eyes. Without the<br>
      dog ugly theme, it's essentially Windows 2000

    <p class="description">
      The fandom for Windows XP (and Windows in general) is one of the dumbest<br>
      communities that one would ever see. The fandom is consists of Children<br>
      who weren't even born when XP was around, and having fake nostalgia for<br>
      Windows XP, and also think that it's the best OS ever. When they've<br>
      clearly only tried it in a Virtual Machine.

    <p class="description">
      Almost everybody that talks about Windows XP always mentions Windows<br>
      Movie Maker. It's not even a good editor, then why everybody keeps<br>
      talking about it? Sure most videos on YouTube at the time were MADE<br>
      with Movie Maker but not everything during that time was made with<br>
      Windows Movie Maker only.

      Windows XP wasn't *the* best operating system that everybody keeps<br>
      saying, using XP now is impossible without CVE exploits, people<br>
      still use XP even after the End-Of-Life and all the CVE exploits.
      <br><br/>
      Is really using an outdated Operating System from 20 years ago<br>
      that has multiple security issues just to have nostalgia from<br>
      a "simpler time"? Times changed, move on from XP.<br>
