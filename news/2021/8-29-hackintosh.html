               <p>
                  Hello, welcome to my first log of my experience doing a Hackintosh. I've been using macOS Mojave for the past 20 days and learned alot about macOS and Hackintosh in general.
               </p>
               <h3>A brick wall</h3>
               <p>
                  For awhile i've been wanting to do a Hackintosh on my main system. Though I hit a brick wall, my iGPU is a Intel HD 2500. Which is not supported on macOS.
               </p>
               <div class="box rounded">
                  The HD 2500 on the other hand only has partial support in Mojave for quick sync features as hardware acceleration is <strong>unsupported</strong> so you will need a compatible dGPU for display purposes.
               </div>
               <p>
                  But didn't stop me from doing a Hackintosh. I bought a used GT 630 from eBay, which is still supported on macOS. Now, I was able to start doing the Hackintosh.
               </p>
               <h3>More Problems</h3>
               <p>
                  I was originally going to make an OpenCore Configuration. But after macOS Mojave finished the installation, there was no option for "macOS Installer", which you'd needed to finish the installation.
               </p>
               <p>
                  I eventually gave up after tinkering and tweaking <code>config.plist</code> and to no avail, and used a premade one on

                           <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon>

                  </a>
                  .
                  Which to my surprise it worked, after some time I was on Setup Assistant. I completed the setup and was glad to see the Mojave wallpaper and desktop.

               <h3>First Thoughts</h3>
               <p>
                  After copying the EFI folder to my SSD and tweaking OpenCore, I started installing programs and tweaking macOS to my liking.
               </p>
               <p>
                  Almost everything works on the Hackintosh, unfortunately the only thing that didn't work is my Wi-Fi card. Which is an Qualcomm Athernos AR93xx.
                  Even after getting help and hair-pulling trying to get it to work, I never got it to work. So I had to resort to using Ethernet.
               </p>

               <h3>Current Issues</h3>
               <p>
                  Currently, not everything works right now. The issues currently are:
               </p>
               <ul>
                  <li>Some USB ports don't work</li>
                  <li>"EFI" entry shows on Boot Picker despite nothing but the OC folder</li>
                  <li>Incompatible Wi-Fi card</li>
                  <li>Sleeping is iffy</li>
                  <li>iMessage/FaceTime not working</li>
               </ul>
               <p>
                  Currently trying my best on fixing these issues, but aren't really a big issue for me.
               </p>
               <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
               <p>
                  It has been over 20 days since I started this, Overall this Hackintosh endeavour went pretty smoothly for me. My previous Hackintosh projects were a pita because of sound/graphics issues. I will post a update when
                  I make a update to OpenCore or do more tweaking to macOS.
