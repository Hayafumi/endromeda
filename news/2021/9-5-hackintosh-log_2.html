                  Hi again, this is the second log of my Hackintosh. This will be a shorter post though, as I've done not a lot.
               </p>
               <h3>Multi-Booting</h3>
               <p>
                  I was thinking of installing Big Sur and Catalina to another drive, to which I did. Everything was fine but, when you boot to Mojave you would get this pop-up.
               </p>
               <div>
                  <img src="incompatible-disk.png">
                  <br>
                  Notification on Mojave after installing Catalina & Big Sur
               </div>
               <p>
                  Saddly, I had to erase Catalina and Big Sur to erase the issue.
               </p>
               <h3>Upgrading</h3>
               <p>
                  For a while I was thinking to upgrade Mojave to Catalina or Big Sur, as I wanted to get features newer versions of macOS has.
               </p>
               <p>
                  But thought it could be a grave mistake to do since it <i>*may*</i> break things on Mojave. But decided to take the risk with absolutely <b><i>NO</i></b> Time Machine backups or any backups.
               </p>
               <div>
                  <img src="install-catalina.png" width="530">
                  <br>
                  Upgrading macOS Mojave to Catalina
               </div>
               <p>
                  After staring at the progress bar for 30 minutes, I booted to Catalina with no issues. And even better, nothing broke from the upgrade.
               </p>
               <div>
                  <img src="/news/2021/catalina-about-mac.png" width="530">
                  <br>
                  About my Mac, now with Catalina!
               </div>
               <h3>Fixing issues</h3>
               <p>
                  One of the issues i've had with OpenCore was getting an error every time at boot.
               </p>
               <div class="box rounded">
                  00:000 00:000 OC: Failed to drop ACPI 54445353 0074734930757043 0 (1) - Not Found
               </div>
               <p>
                  Which was a minor issue, but still wanted to remove it. Fortunately, I was able to fix it by disabling <code>Delete Cpu0Ist</code> and <code>Delete CpuPm</code> on <code>config.plist</code>.
               </p>
               <p>
                  Unfortunately, I'm not able to get WI-FI working with the current card i'm using. Though, I could buy another card that will work with macOS.
               </p>

                  Current macOS Catalina setup.

               <h3>Closure</h3>
               <p>
                  So far, not lot has happened since the last Hackintosh log, though i'll try do my best to make another log with more stuff i've done with my Hackintosh.
