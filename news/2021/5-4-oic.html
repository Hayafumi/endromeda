			    <h2>The OIC is a drama landfill</h2>
			    <h5>May 4, 2021</h5>
			        <p>
                        The OIC (Old Internet Community) is an kindergarten playground and 5 years old kids fighting around, but it's through harassment and doing. OIC is a hellhole powered by toxicity.
                    </p>
                <h3>Old Roblox Community</h3>
                    <p>
                        The ORC (Old Roblox Community) is one of the worst offenders of the OIC, Doxxing happens so much, it's pretty much a normal thing in the ORC.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Most of the time, a ORC is made, then it goes all good untill a drama hapends, then it forever shuts down, the community of the ORC is like finding a kid on Xbox Live, without the kid being funny.
                    </p> 
                <h3> Old YouTube Community</h3>
                    <p>
                        This is the second-worst offender, the OYC (Old Youtube Community) can't seem to like each other, and is always fighting on which revival is the best.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Content on revivals is the worst thing ever, a lot of the time it's just reuploads of old videos from YouTube, what's the point? Nobody is gonna actually watch it and would just watch it on YouTube instead. Also, a lot of the content is also just shitty Windows Movie Maker videos trying to be hard at creating old-style videos, other editors exist in 2008 and 2007 (Looking at you BitView and Vidlii). There's almost no original content on revivals, and if they're, it's mostly won't be watched.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And a lot of these revivals are so poorly made, they're not even useable as a video platform, and some of these are just crap Yooco platforms or stolen source code.
                    </p>
