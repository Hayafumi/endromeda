    <p class="description">
      The OIC (Old Internet Community) is an<br>
      kindergarden playground and 5 year old<br>
      kids fighting around, but it's through<br>
      harrassment and doxxing. OIC is a hellhole<br>
      powered by toxicity.<br />
      <p class="paragraph_name">Old Roblox Community</p>
    <p class="description">
      The ORC (Old Roblox Community) is one of the worst offenders of the OIC,<br>
      Doxxing happends so much, it's pretty much a normal thing in the ORC.<br />
      <br />
      Most of the time, a ORC is made, then it goes all good untill a drama<br>
      hapends, then it forever shuts down, the community of the ORC is like<br>
      finding a kid on Xbox Live, without the kid being funny.<br />
      <p class="paragraph_name">Old YouTube Community</p>
    <p class="description">
      This is the second worst offender, the OYC (Old Youtube Community) can't<br>
      seem to like eachother, and is always fighting on which revival is the best.<br />
      <br />
      Content on revivals are the worst things every, alot of the times it's just<br>
      reuploads of old videos from YouTube, what's the point? Nobody is gonna<br>
      actually watch it and would just watch it on YouTube instead. Also,<br>
      alot of the content is also just shitty Windows Movie Maker videos<br>
      trying to be hard at creating old-style videos, other editors exist<br>
      in 2008 and 2007 (Looking at you BitView and Vidlii). There's almost<br>
      no original content on revivals, and if they're, it's mostly won't<br>
      be watched.<br />
      <br />
      And alot of these revivals are so poorly made, they're not even<br>
      useable as a video platform, and some of these are just crap<br>
      Yooco platforms or stolen source code.<br />
