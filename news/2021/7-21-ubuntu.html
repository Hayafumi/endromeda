<p class="title">Ubuntu is horrible<br>--------------------------------------</p>
    <p class="description">
      Ubuntu is a Linux Distro that has a terrible<br>
      theme, so much bloat, and a resource hog to<br>
      systems. Ubuntu is a <i>fine</i> starter distro,<br>
      but there is much better Linux distros that<br>
      are ALSO easy to use.<br>

      Snapd is a "Package Manager", if you can call it that. It's made by
      Canonical, same jackasses that made Ubuntu. But instead of installing
      the program to the system, it's just a container with the program.
      Which can be a absolute mess if you have multible Snap packages.

    <p class="description">
      Snap Packages are larger then traditional APT packages, another
      package manager on Debian-based distros. Snap packages also tend
      to be slower to run, because they need to be mounted before
      running. Snap is also proprietary software. I recondmend
      using alternate package managers, like Flatpak. Or i'll do one
      better, use a traditional package manager.
  <p class="paragraph_name">Spyware</p>
    <p class="description">
      Before Ubuntu 16.04, Canonical was tracking Ubuntu users and
      turning the information to Amazon. In other words, spyware.
      But ever since Ubuntu 16.04, the spyware has been disabled,
      good. Ubuntu also had "Amazon Search" as a default search
      function, also disabled in later versions of Ubuntu.

      Ubuntu when you boot it up for the first time looks ugly,
      so much orange and gray. It's even worse that it's GNOME.
      Hell, default GNOME looks way better than Ubuntu's Deafult.

      It looks horrible, worse than any default DE that you would
      see in any other GNU/Linux distros. It stands out, but in a
      bad way. Canonical really gotta make GNOME look like their
      own branding. Though, Unity and GNOME 2, former desktop
      enviornments look WAY better then their successer.

  <p class="paragraph_name">Alternatives</p>
    <p class="description">
      I've done enough ranting on Ubuntu and Canonical's bullshit. But is there
      anything else you can use? Of course, for a distro for starters I recondmend
      Manjaro, Fedora, and Debian. If you want a more minimal distro, Arch Linux
      is a pretty good distro for that. With a awesome package manager and tons
      of ArchWiki pages.<br><br>
      For Snapd I once again recondmend using Flatpak, or using any traditional
      package manager you can. Hell, you can also compile programs. For Arch
      Linux though, there is alot of AUR (Arch Linux Repository) packages
      for aton of things.
  <p class="paragraph_name">Conclusion</p>
    <p class="description">
      The conclusion to this post is don't use Ubuntu. It's bloated, spyware,
      it's outdated, etc. And don't even touch container package managers either.
