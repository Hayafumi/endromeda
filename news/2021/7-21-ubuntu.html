<p class="title">Ubuntu is horrible<br>--------------------------------------</p>
    <p class="description">
      Ubuntu is a Linux Distro that has a terrible
      theme, so much bloat, and a resource hog to
      systems. Ubuntu is a <i>fine</i> starter distro,
      but there is much better Linux distros that
      are ALSO easy to use.

      Snapd is a "Package Manager" if you can call it that.<br>
      It's made by Canonical, the same jackasses that made Ubuntu. But instead of installing the<br>
      program to the system, it's just a container with the program. Which can be an absolute mess<br>
      if you have multiple Snap packages.

      Snap Packages are larger than traditional APT packages, another<br>
      package manager on Debian-based distros. Snap packages also tend<br>
      to be slower to run, because they need to be mounted before<br>
      running. Snap is also proprietary software. I recommend using<br>
      alternate package managers, like Flatpak. Or I'll do one better<br>
      use a traditional package manager.
  <p class="paragraph_name">Spyware</p>
    <p class="description">
      Before Ubuntu 16.04, Canonical was tracking Ubuntu users and<br>
      turning the information to Amazon. In other words, spyware.<br>
      But ever since Ubuntu 16.04, the spyware has been disabled,<br>
      good. Ubuntu also had "Amazon Search" as a default search<br>
      function, also disabled in later versions of Ubuntu.

    <p class="description">
      Ubuntu when you boot it up for the first time looks ugly,<br>
      so much orange and gray. It's even worse that it's GNOME.<br>
      Hell, default GNOME looks way better than Ubuntu's Default.

      It looks horrible, worse than any default DE that you would<br>
      see in any other GNU/Linux distros. It stands out but in a<br>
      bad way. Canonical really gotta make GNOME look like their<br>
      own branding. Though, Unity and GNOME 2, former desktop<br>
      environments look WAY better than their successor.

      I've done enough ranting on Ubuntu and Canonical's bullshit. But is there<br>
      anything else you can use? Of course, for a distro for starters, I<br>
      recommend Manjaro, Fedora, and Debian. If you want a more minimal distro,<br>
      Arch Linux is a pretty good distro for that. With an awesome package manager<br>
      and tons of ArchWiki pages.<br><br>
      For Snapd I once again recommend using Flatpak or using any traditional<br>
      package manager you can. Hell, you can also compile programs. For Arch<br>
      Linux though, there is alot of AUR (Arch Linux Repository) packages for<br>
      a ton of things.<br>
  <p class="paragraph_name">Conclusion</p>
    <p class="description">
      The conclusion to this post is don't use Ubuntu. It's bloated, spyware,
      it's outdated, etc. And don't even touch container package managers either.
