<p class="title">Ubuntu is horrible<br>--------------------------------------</p>
    <p class="description">
      Ubuntu is a Linux Distro that has a terrible
      theme, so much bloat, and a resource hog to
      systems. Ubuntu is a <i>fine</i> starter distro,
      but there is much better Linux distros that
      are ALSO easy to use.

      Snapd is a "Package Manager" if you can call it that.<br>
      It's made by Canonical, the same jackasses that made Ubuntu. But instead of<br>
      installing the program to the system, it's just a container with the program.<br>
      Which can be an absolute mess if you have multiple Snap packages.

      Snap Packages are larger than traditional APT packages, another package manager<br>
      on Debian-based distros. Snap packages also tend to be slower to run, because<br>
      they need to be mounted before running. Snap is also proprietary software. I<br>
      recommend using alternate package managers, like Flatpak. Or I'll do one better<br>
      use a traditional package manager.
  <p class="paragraph_name">Spyware</p>
    <p class="description">
      Before Ubuntu 16.04, Canonical was tracking Ubuntu users and turning the<br>
      information to Amazon. In other words, spyware. But ever since Ubuntu 16.04, the<br>
      spyware has been disabled, good. Ubuntu also had "Amazon Search" as a default<br>
      search function, also disabled in later versions of Ubuntu.<br>

    <p class="description">
      Ubuntu when you boot it up for the first time looks ugly, so much orange<br>
      and gray. It's even worse that it's GNOME. Hell, default GNOME looks<br>
      way better than Ubuntu's Default.<br>

      It looks horrible, worse than any default DE that you would see in any<br>
      other GNU/Linux distros. It stands out but in a bad way. Canonical<br>
      really gotta make GNOME look like their own branding. Though, Unity<br>
      and GNOME 2, former desktop environments look WAY better than their<br>
      successors.

      I've done enough ranting on Ubuntu and Canonical's bullshit. But is there<br>
      anything else you can use? Of course, for a distro for starters, I<br>
      recommend Manjaro, Fedora, and Debian. If you want a more minimal distro,<br>
      Arch Linux is a pretty good distro for that. With an awesome package manager<br>
      and tons of ArchWiki pages.<br><br>
      For Snapd I once again recommend using Flatpak or using any traditional<br>
      package manager you can. Hell, you can also compile programs. For Arch<br>
      Linux though, there is alot of AUR (Arch Linux Repository) packages for<br>
      a ton of things.<br>
  <p class="paragraph_name">Conclusion</p>
    <p class="description">
      The conclusion to this post is don't use Ubuntu. It's bloated, spyware,
      it's outdated, etc. And don't even touch container package managers either.
