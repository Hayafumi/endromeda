<p class="title">A first look at Windows 11<br>--------------------------------------</p>
    <p class="description">
      We're going to take a first look at Microsoft's<br>
      recently leaked Operating System, Windows 11.<br>
      Which, I took a test drive on a VM. It sucks,<br>
      A LOT.<br/>

      As I said in the article relating to Windows 10,<br>
      computers are not mobile devices. Windows 11 is literally the failed<br>
      project named "Windows 10x". Microsoft has completely forgotten that<br>
      computers exist and that everybody is using mobile devices. Did they even<br>
      consider desktops and laptops? Not everything has to be a touch screen.<br>
      <br><br/>
      Microsoft is doing the EXACT same thing as they did with Windows 8, making<br>
      it designed only for tablets in mind, on Windows 10 sure they changed <i>SOME</i><br>
      differences to make it fit with desktops more, but the padding and all still<br>
      made it feel that it's for tablets or mobile devices only.

      The new "look" of Windows 11 sucks, Microsoft is trying hard to copy Apple<br>
      with macOS, even with checkboxes. Microsoft is trying to round everything,<br>
      the same exact thing that Apple is doing. The round windows are UGLY, at<br>
      least Apple implemented it right 20 YEARS AGO. It looks so unfinished,<br>
      while I do that it's a leaked beta, but at least make the window corners
      antialiased?
      <br/><br/>
      Don't get me started on the taskbar, Microsoft was a dick enough to REMOVE<br>
      the option to make the taskbar small, or change the position. It's only<br>
      one size, one position. And what's with the centered icons? It doesn't<br>
      feel right going to the bottom to access the start menu, but at least<br>
      Microsoft was KIND enough to give an option to put it on the left.
      <br/><br/>
      As of today (May 16, 2021), Open-Shell is completely broken, so you're<br>
      stuck with the god-awful start menu that is hard to navigate.<br>
      Microsoft fucked up the taskbar so much that current solutions does not<br>
      work yet with it, we all have to wait until the programs get updated.<br>
