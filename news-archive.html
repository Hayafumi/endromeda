               <h2>Small Updates</h2>
               <h5>July 22, 2021</h5>
               <p>
                  Haddn't done that much updates to this site as I did before. Main reason
                  being I don't know what to add to this website, but I added some things to endromeda.
                  <br><br>
                  However, I've added some minor updates. such updates are making the posts
                  page organized by month, less ugly article dates, and a viewer for
                  images.
               </p>
               <h2>10k Views!</h2>
               <h5>July 5, 2021</h5>
               <p>
                  Thank you to everybody who had viewed my page, because we just hit 10k views! Along with this achivement, i've revamped the articles, contact and soon the about page. Enjoy!
               </p>
               <h2>Beta Website</h2>
               <h5>June 11, 2021</h5>
               <p>
                  I have a beta website, where I try out new things and see if they should be on the main website, the beta page is at /beta/.
                  <i>(endromeda beta is now gone.)</i>
               </p>
               <h2>5k Views</h2>
               <h5>May 29, 2021</h5>
               <p>
                  We have hit 5k views on endromeda! I'm very surprised that we even hit to 5k, thanks to people who actually viewed my website.

               <h2>Cleaner Code & Favicon</h2>
               <h5>May 22, 2021</h5>
               <p>
                  Sup, in this entire website, i've been using several style tags, and the code looked like a MESS.<br><br>Now, most of the crap is on classes on a CSS file. and now there's FINALLY a favicon. Most of the site has not been cleaned up, i've only done the home page, but the entire site will be much cleaner!
               </p>
               <h2>Articles!</h2>
               <h5>May 3, 2021</h5>
               <p>
                  Hello, hadden't update the site in a awhile, but i've decided to add a new part of the website, articles!<br><br>
                  No longer the links page, which was pointless is now replaced with something much more useful! Artices is about anything, tech, food, anything. I'm planning to add an rss feed to endromeda to follow articles, but that will come another time. Cya!
               </p>
