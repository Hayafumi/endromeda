<b>8.2.2021 - what is this?</b>
<hr>
<p>you may be wondering, what happend to the site. well, we just changed
layouts!reason being the old layout had garbage css. and i want to change
the look of the website, of course.</p>
<b>7.22.2021 - small updates</b>
<hr>
<p>i haddn't done that much updates to this site as i did before. main reason<br>
being i don't know what to add to this website, but i added some things to
endromeda.<br><br>
but, i added some minor updates. such updates are making the posts<br>
page organized by month, less ugly article dates, and a viewer for<br>
images.</p>
<b>7.5.2021 - 10k views!!!</b>
<hr>
<p>thank you to everybody who had viewed my page,
because we just hit 10k views! along with this
achivement, i've revamped the articles, contact
and soon the about page. enjoy!</p>
<b>6.11.2021 - beta website</b>
<hr>
<p>i have a beta website, where i try out new
things and see if they should be on the main
website, the beta page is at /beta/.<br>
<i>(endromeda beta is now gone.)</i></p>
<b>5.29.2021 - 5k views!</b>
<hr>
<p>we have hit 5k views on endromeda! i'm very
surprised that we even hit to 5k, thanks to
people who actually viewed my website.</p>
<b>5.22.2021 - cleaner code & favicon</b>
<hr>
<p>sup, in this entire website, i've been using
several style tags, and the code looked like
a MESS. now, most of the crap is on classes
on a css file. and now there's FINALLY a
favicon.

most of the site has not been cleaned up,
i've only done the home page, but the entire
site will be much cleaner!</p>
<b>5.22.2021 - rss feed</b>
<hr>
<p>it's been awhile since i've updated the website
but, i've added a rss feed for articles, if you
want to add the rss feed, the feed url will be
in the articles page, have fun!</p>
<b>5.3.2021 - articles!!!</b>
<hr>
<p>hello, hadden't update the site in a awhile, but
i've decided to add a new part of the website,
articles!

no longer the links page,which was pointless
is now replaced with something much more useful!
artices is about anything, tech, food, anything.
i'm planning to add an rss feed to endromeda to
follow articles, but that will come another time.
cya!</p>
<b>4.30.2021 - website finished!</b>
<hr>
<p>hi, i am glad to say that the website is finished!
of course, thid doesn't mean things will change,
im planning to add more features will be added in
the future. </p>
<b>4.29.2021 - site almost completed!</b>
<hr>
<p>hey again, been working hard on this website
as a person with no html and and little css
knowledge it was kinda hard to do,
but i'm getting the hang of it!

alot more will come soon, trust me</p>
<b>4.29.2021 - website is up!</b>
