<font size="3"><b>Small Updates</b></font><br>
<i>July 22, 2021</i>
<hr>
<p>i haddn't done that much updates to this site as i did before. main reason<br>
being i don't know what to add to this website, but i added some things to
endromeda.<br><br>
but, i added some minor updates. such updates are making the posts<br>
page organized by month, less ugly article dates, and a viewer for<br>
images.</p>
<font size="3"><b>10k Views!</b></font><br>
<i>July 5, 2021</i>

achivement, i've revamped the articles, contact

<i>June 11, 2021</i>

things and see if they should be on the main

surprised that we even hit to 5k, thanks to
people who actually viewed my website.</p>
<font size="3"><b>Cleaner Code & Favicon</b></font><br>
<i>May 22, 2021</i>
<hr>
<p>sup, in this entire website, i've been using
several style tags, and the code looked like
a MESS. now, most of the crap is on classes
on a css file. and now there's FINALLY a
favicon.

most of the site has not been cleaned up,
i've only done the home page, but the entire
site will be much cleaner!</p>
<font size="3"><b>RSS Feed</b></font><br>
<i>May 22, 2021</i>
<hr>
<p>it's been awhile since i've updated the website
but, i've added a rss feed for articles, if you
want to add the rss feed, the feed url will be
in the articles page, have fun!</p>
<font size="3"><b>Articles</b></font><br>
<i>May 3, 2021</i>
<hr>
<p>hello, hadden't update the site in a awhile, but
i've decided to add a new part of the website,
articles!

no longer the links page,which was pointless
is now replaced with something much more useful!
artices is about anything, tech, food, anything.
i'm planning to add an rss feed to endromeda to
follow articles, but that will come another time.
cya!</p>
<font size="3"><b>Website finished</b></font><br>

<i>April 29, 2021</i>
<hr>
