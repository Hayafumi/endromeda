<hr>
    <p>
        Somewhere in February 2021, Firefox has put
        a new Proton redesign in the nightly builds
        of Firefox. In this article, Iâ€™m going to be
        ranting on why the Firefox Proton redesign
        is absolute SHIT.<br><br>
    <b>"Tabs"</b>
    <p>
        The tabs look like crap, it's unnecessary big enough and takes a lot of
        web content. Large and rounded tabs are not necessary and it looks ugly
        as fuck. It doesn't even look like proper tabs, they're not attached to
        the navigation bar. It's just floating pill shape buttons that are
        way too big for my liking, and most likings.<br><br>
    <b>Padding for touch screens?</b>
    <p>
        The spacing between everything, it's disgusting. Everything is so spread
        out and so big, it's like it's made for a tablet, did Mozilla forget that
        Do PCs and Macs exist? Most of them don't even have a touch screen.
        Even if they made it for tablets or whatever, why? The buttons are big enough
        that a finger can touch, why more padding to space them out?<br>
        <br/>
        Some of you may ask, "why are you complaining just use compact mode?".
        Mozilla had the BALLS to remove Compact mode from the proton redesign
        saying that it's "Unsupported", Unsupported my ASS you could have just
        minimized the padding and make everything smaller, but no! We're
        stuck with the big as fuck UI that looks like it's made for a touch screen.<br><br>
    <b>Edit:</b>
    <p>
        I recently heard that it is possible to disable
        the shit redesign through a config in about:config,
        Thanks to Mozilla for having a brain cell.
