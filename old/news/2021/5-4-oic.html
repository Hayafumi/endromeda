<hr>
    <p>
        The OIC (Old Internet Community) is an
        kindergarten playground and 5 years old
        kids fighting around, but it's through
        harassment and doing. OIC is a hellhole
        powered by toxicity.<br><br>
    <b>Old Roblox Community</b>
    <p>
        The ORC (Old Roblox Community) is one of the worst offenders of the OIC,
        Doxxing happens so much, it's pretty much a normal thing in the ORC.<br/>
        <br />
        Most of the time, a ORC is made, then it goes all good untill a drama
        hapends, then it forever shuts down, the community of the ORC is like
        finding a kid on Xbox Live, without the kid being funny.<br><br>
    <b>Old YouTube Community</b>
    <p>
        This is the second-worst offender, the OYC (Old Youtube Community) can't
        seem to like each other, and is always fighting on which revival is the best.
        <br /><br />
        Content on revivals is the worst thing ever, a lot of the time it's just
        reuploads of old videos from YouTube, what's the point? Nobody is gonna
        actually watch it and would just watch it on YouTube instead. Also,
        a lot of the content is also just shitty Windows Movie Maker videos
        trying to be hard at creating old-style videos, other editors exist
        in 2008 and 2007 (Looking at you BitView and Vidlii). There's almost no
        original content on revivals, and if they're, it's mostly won't be
        watched.
        <br /><br />
        And a lot of these revivals are so poorly made, they're not even
        useable as a video platform, and some of these are just crap
        Yooco platforms or stolen source code.<br><br>
