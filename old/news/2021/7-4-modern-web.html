<b style="font-size:15px;">Modern Web is a bloated mess</b>
<hr>
    <p>
        The birth of the web was a basic one, simple
        text documents and gifs. Nowadays, the web is
        such a bloated mess, you can't have a single
        bit of privacy now.<br><br>
    <b>Pool of Javascript files</b>
    <p>
        Why does every single website have a boatload off
        Javascript files? Javascript was a mistake from the start,
        PHP is arguably alot better than JS. You don't need JS to make
        a good website. Most of the websites of JS are bad anyways,
        they take up resources and take forever to load.
        <br><br/>
        Even though Javascript does have a few benefits, most websites use so much
        Javascript files it's unbelievable.<br/><br/>
    <b>Advertisements and Pop-Ups</b>
    <p>
        So many websites have a ton of Pop-Ups and Advertisements, so much that
        something simple as scrolling the website could be choppy and laggy.
        You're better off filling the whole page with them and not see a single
        pixel of the actual content that you're looking for, and why the hell
        do you have to make an account just to view the website? To try and
        get more members on the site?<br><br>
    <b>Sell all my information!</b>
    <p>
        Do you seriously have any privacy on the modern internet, corporations
        like Facebook have millions of personal data, almost everything about
        them. Knowing that my personal information about me is being sold
        scares the shit out of me.
        <br><br/>
        You do not have privacy, pretty much multiple corporations are watching
        what you're doing every second.
