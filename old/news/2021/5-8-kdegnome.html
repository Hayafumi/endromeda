    <p>
        Gnome 3 and KDE Plasma is trash, every
        setup I see with one of them looks so ugly
        and blinds my eyes. Gnome and KDE had lost
        their way of making an actual good Desktop
        environment.<br><br>
    <b>Space Heater</b>

        They require NASA Computers for them to not run like shit. A desktop
        environment should not take that many system resources. Don't even
        get me started with the start-up times, Plasma takes your entire
        lifetime just to start up, I need to use the system NOW.<br><br>
    <b>"Eyecandy"</b>
    <p>
        Every GNOME/KDE setup I see is so ugly, I wish I can bleach my eyes.
        With KDE setups, a lot of times, there's so much blur on the setup it's
        disgusting, and icons most of the time look like clipart taken from
        Google Docs.<br><br>
        GNOME also sucks, it's pretty much the same as KDE but with 10x the
        padding, why is everything so spaced out? Same thing with Windows 10,
        It's like it's designed for tablets, not Desktops. At least Windows 10
        had a tablet mode, but GNOME doesn't have any of that, you're stuck with
        the massive buttons and padding unless you make a custom theme.
