<b style="font-size:15px;">Windows XP is Overrated</b>
<hr>
        <p>
            Windows XP is one of the ugliest and most
            overrated operating systems are known to man.
            And people who weren't even born when XP was
            released say that it's the "best OS" ever.
            <br><br/> 

    <b>Ugly theme</b>
        <p>
            Windows XP's "Luna" theme looks like absolute
            garbage. It's literally a Fisher-Price theme for an operating system.
            Classic Theme is a lot better doesn't hurt one's eyes. Without the
            dog ugly theme, it's essentially Windows 2000<br><br>
    <b>The Fandom</b>
        <p>
            The fandom for Windows XP (and Windows in general) is one of the dumbest
            communities that one would ever see. The fandom is consists of Children
            who weren't even born when XP was around, and having fake nostalgia for
            Windows XP, and also think that it's the best OS ever. When they've
            clearly only tried it in a Virtual Machine.<br><br>
    <b>Windows Movie Player</b>
        <p>
            Almost everybody that talks about Windows XP always mentions Windows
            Movie Maker. It's not even a good editor, then why everybody keeps
            talking about it? Sure most videos on YouTube at the time were MADE
            with Movie Maker but not everything during that time was made with
            Windows Movie Maker only.<br><br>
    <b>Overrated</b>
        <p>
            Windows XP wasn't *the* best operating system that everybody keeps
            saying, using XP now is impossible without CVE exploits, people
            still use XP even after the End-Of-Life and all the CVE exploits.
            <br><br/>
            Is really using an outdated Operating System from 20 years ago
            that has multiple security issues just to have nostalgia from
            a "simpler time"? Times changed, move on from XP.
