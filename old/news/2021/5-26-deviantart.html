    <p>
        The DeviantART redesign is one of the worst
        redesigns I've ever seen, Even worse than
        YouTube Polymer, it's a buggy, slow, confusing
        mess of a redesign.<br><br>
    <b>Login to download</b>
    <p>
        This is one of the worst "features" that DeviantArt
        ever made, you HAVE to log in or create an account just to download
        something, why?<br/><br/>
        It's not necessary to force people to create an account just for
        downloads, it wasn't like this before, when you click download your
        get the download. Most of your userbase are just accounts with
        nothing that are ONLY used just for downloads, no actual creators
        and stuff.<br><br>
    <b>Forced redesign</b>
    <p>
        As I said, the redesign SUCKS, DeviantART was using the same design for a
        decade. If it works, don't fix it, But DeviantART alongside the god-awful
        forced login to download feature, which was forced!<br><br>
        Well before, DeviantArt gave you an option to disable the redesign but
        later on, they REMOVED it. Forcing you to use it, if you like it or not. At
        least Reddit had some sense about putting their old design in old.reddit.com,
        you can even make it the main layout of the website
