                        I didn't expect for me to make another log so quickly, but a fair bit more advanced made on my Hackintosh.

    <b>Updating OpenCore</b>

                    <p>
                        As I last said in the first Hackintosh log:
                    </p>

"I was originally going to make a OpenCore EFI Folder. But when the installer of Mojave is finished, there was no option for "macOS Installer", which is needed to actually finish the installation.<br><br>
I eventually gave up with it after tinkering and tweaking the EFI Folder to no avail, and <b>used a premade one on <a href="https://github.com/dps910/Dell-Optiplex-7010-Hackintosh-OpenCore">GitHub.                        <span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></span></a></a></b>"

                    <p>
                        Therefore i've always stayed with the EFI folder from GitHub. Untill I read a PSA regarding OpenCore 0.7.2, the version that I had trouble with.
                    </p>

        <td class="hmcontainer2">
"In addition, the default Secure Boot model has been changed to x86legacy (from j137 - iMacPro1,1) which restricts boot to 11.0.1 and up.<br><br>
Why do you care? Well, if you're using OC with SecureBootModel set to Default, you won't be able to boot High Sierra - Catalina anymore without changing the value. And if you don't have Big Sur or above installed on the <b>same disk</b>, you won't <b>even see APFS volumes in the boot picker</b>"

        </tr>
        </tbody>
        </table>
                    <p>
                        After reading i've immediately started to create my own EFI folder. To fix the issue, I had to change <code>SecureBootModel</code> from <code>Default</code> to <code>j137</code>. After finishing editing config.plist,
                        I booted into the USB with the EFI Folder and hoped it will boot into Catalina.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And to my surprise, it did! I finally updated OpenCore to 0.7.2, including updating Kexts. After that I fixed <a href="https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Post-Install/universal/pm.html#sandy-and-ivy-bridge-power-management">Power Management                        <span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></span></a></a> with <a href="https://github.com/Piker-Alpha/ssdtPRGen.sh">ssdtPRGen                        <span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></span></a></a>, since i'm using a Ivy Bridge processor.

    <b>Installing Big Sur</b>
                    <p>
                        I decided to install Big Sur on my SSD along with Catalina. It went sucessful and without a notification on Catalina bugging me.
                    </p>
                    <div>
                        <img src="/news/2021/big_sur-about-my-mac.png" width="420">
                        <br>
                        Unfortunately didn't screenshot me installing Big Sur, so here's About my Mac!
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        Only thing that was annoying was that there was a "Update" drive on Catalina, but after some reading it's important for Big Sur, so I can't do anything with it :(.
                    </p>
    <b>Ironing even more issues</b>
                    <p>
                        Another issue I always had was a "EFI" entry on the Boot Picker, as mentioned in Log #1.
                    </p>
        <table class="hmcontainer" width="100%">
        <tbody>
        <tr>
        <td class="hmcontainer2">
                                "EFI" entry shows on Boot Picker despite there's nothing but the OC folder
        </td>
        </tr>
        </tbody>
        </table>
                    <p>
                        But was gone when I made a EFI folder from scratch, must be a issue with the one off of GitHub.
                    </p>
    <b>Drive icons on OpenCanopy</b>
                    <p>
                        I've also wanted to make OpenCanopy look more nice, by using custom drive icons for each macOS version that is shown in the picker.
                    </p>
                                        <p>
                        After reading the OpenCore documentation, I figured out that you have to change <code>PickerAttribute</code> to <code>145</code> and put <code>&lt;flavor&gt;.icns</code> on the Resources folder. So, I did it. After getting the icons from <a href="https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher/">
                        OpenCore legacy Patcher

                    </p>
                                        <div>

                        My current OpenCore Boot Picker
                    </div>
<b>Final words</b>
                    <p>
                        Finally being able to fix some problems that always bugged me, and finally installing Big Sur was relieving. But that's all for this log, Log #4 will come soon... Bye!
