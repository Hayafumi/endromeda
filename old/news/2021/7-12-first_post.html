<hr>
    <p>
        You're currently viewing the first endromeda
        post. I've given articles another purpose, where
        I can make posts that aren't as long as articles,
        because why not? There are some answers you may
        have and I'm going to answer them in this post.<br><br>
    <b>Will there be articles?</b>
    <p>
        Of course, even though I currently don't have ideas for any articles,
        articles will be made along with posts.<br><br>
    <b>What are posts?</b>
    <p>
        They're pretty much blogs, I'm going to be making posts like devlogs
        of endromeda and such.<br><br>
    <b>What will happend to the old articles?</b>
    <p>
        Nothing, you can still access them.<br><br>
    <b>Will there going to be often articles/posts?</b>
    <p>
        I might make more often articles, I have no ideas though. For posts,
        I would only post whenever I feel like it.<br><br>
