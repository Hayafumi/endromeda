<b style="font-size:15px;">Hackintosh Log #1</b>
<hr>
    <p>
 Hello, welcome to my first log of my experience doing a Hackintosh. I've been using macOS Mojave for the past 20 days and learned alot about macOS and Hackintosh in general. 
    </p>
    <b>A brick wall</b>
        <p>
 For awhile i've been wanting to do a Hackintosh on my main system. Though I hit a brick wall, my iGPU is a Intel HD 2500. Which is not supported on macOS. 
        </p>
        <table class="hmcontainer" width="100%">
        <tbody>
        <tr>
        <td class="hmcontainer2">
        <i>"The HD 2500 on the other hand only has partial support in Mojave for quick sync features as hardware acceleration is <b>unsupported</b> so you will need a compatible dGPU for display purposes."</i>
        </td>
        </tr>
        </tbody>
        </table>
        <p>
         But it didn't stop me from doing a Hackintosh. I bought a used GT 630 from eBay, which is still supported on macOS (surprisingly). Now, I was able to start doing the Hackintosh. 
        </p>
    <b>More Problems</b>
        <p>
 I was originally going to make a OpenCore EFI Folder. But when the installer of Mojave is finished, there was no option for "macOS Installer", which is needed to actually finish the installation. 
 </p>
 <p>
                        I eventually gave up with it after tinkering and tweaking the EFI Folder to no avail, and used a premade one on <a class="link" href="https://github.com/dps910/Dell-Optiplex-7010-Hackintosh-OpenCore">GitHub<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></span></a>.
                        Which to my surprise it actually worked, after some time I was on the Setup Assistant. I completed the setup and was glad to see the macOS Mojave wallpaper and desktop.

    <b>First Thoughts</b>
                    <p>
                        After copying the EFI folder to the SSD and done tweaks to it, I started installing programs and tweaking macOS to my liking.
                    </p><p>
                        Almost everything works on the Hackintosh, but unfortunately the only thing that doesn't work is my Wi-Fi card. Which is a Qualcomm Athernos AR93xx.
                        Even after getting help and hair pulling trying to get it to work, I never got it to work. So I had to resort to using ethernet.
                    </p>

    <b>Current Issues</b>
<p>
Not everything works right now, the current issues are:
</p>
                          <ul class="normal">
                            <li>Some USB Ports don't work</li>
                            <li>"EFI" entry shows on Boot Picker despite there's nothing but the OC folder</li>
                            <li>Incompatible Wi-Fi card</li>
                            <li>Sleeping is iffy</li>
                            <li>iMessage/FaceTime not working</li>
                          </ul>
<p>
Currently doing my best in fixing these issues, but they aren't really a big issue for me.
</p>
    <b>Final Thoughts</b>
        <p>

                        It has been over 20 days since I started this, Overall this Hackintosh endeavour went pretty smoothly for me. My previous Hackintosh projects were a pita because of sound/graphics issues. I will post a update when
                        I make a update to my OpenCore EFI or do more tweaks to macOS.
