                i haddn't done that much updates to this site
                as i did before. main reason being i don't
                know what to add to this website, but i added
                some things to endromeda.
                but, i added some minor updates. such updates
                are making the posts page organized by month,
                less ugly article dates, and a viewer for images.

            <div class="HLText center updates">5.22.2021 - cleaner code & favicon</div><br>
              <div class="HLText center">
                sup, in this entire website, i've been using
                several style tags, and the code looked like
                a MESS. now, most of the crap is on classes
                on a css file. and now there's FINALLY a
                favicon.
                most of the site has not been cleaned up,
                i've only done the home page, but the entire
                site will be much cleaner!

            <div class="HLText center updates">5.22.2021 - rss feed</div><br>

                it's been awhile since i've updated the website
                but, i've added a rss feed for articles, if you
                want to add the rss feed, the feed url will be
                in the articles page, have fun!

                hello, hadden't update the site in a awhile, but
                i've decided to add a new part of the website,
                articles!
                no longer the links page,which was pointless
                now replaced with something much more useful!
                artices is about anything, tech, food, anything.
                i'm planning to add an rss feed to endromeda to
                follow articles, but that will come another time.
                cya!
